    <h1 class="page-title">Fetuccinni recipe</h1>
    <p>There are certain recipes that are essential to have in your recipe box and one of them has to be a phenomenal Fettuccine alfredo recipe.  Years ago, when I was teaching kids' cooking classes, this was one of the first things I taught them. Almost every single kid around goes crazy for alfredo sauce! It is so easy to make a homemade alfredo sauce that you will never buy the jarred variety again!

    <p>This homemade alfredo sauce is made with simple ingredients -- butter, parmesan cheese, garlic, heavy cream, and salt. It's a 5-ingredient alfredo sauce that is beyond easy!
    </p>
    <p>
        This homemade alfredo sauce can be tossed with the pasta so the pasta soaks up all of the sauce or it can be spooned over hot, fresh pasta.  I love to use fresh refrigerated fettuccine noodles because it tastes that much better. If you want the fettuccine alfredo to be a little more "saucy" toss the sauce with less than one pound of pasta (you may start with 12 ounces of fettuccine).

    <ul class="ingredients">
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <li>Fettuccini</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Heavy Cream</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <li>Start by bringing water to a boil in a large pot</li>
        <p>
            Add salt to the water to season the pasta. Once it is boiling, add pasta and cook according to package instructions.
        </p>
        <li>Saute the garlic and butter together</li>
        <p>
            until softened -- about 1 to 2 minutes.
        </p>
        <li>Add heavy cream</li>
        <p>
            and let simmer over medium-high heat for about 5 minutes to thicken. Add salt and pepper to taste. Add half of the parmesan cheese to the mixture and whisk well until smooth.
        </p>
        <li>Save some pasta water</li>
        <p>The pasta water is full of flavor and can be used to thin out the sauce.</p>
        <li>Toss alfredo sauce with fettuccine pasta</li>
        <p>
            and add half of the parmesan cheese. Once it is tossed, garnish with the remaining parmesan cheese. Add a little pasta water if it needs to be thinned out.
        </p>
        <li>Garnish with Italian parsley,</li>
        <p>if so desired</p>
    </ol>
